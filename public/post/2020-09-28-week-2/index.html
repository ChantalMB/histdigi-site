<p>At the beginning of the week, my qualms were in the realm of ethics, but now as I&rsquo;m writing this having completed the majority of my field work, they are entirely physical&hellip;</p>
<p>Interestingly, I was initially more concerned about the ethical aspects of documenting a cemetery than the ethics surrounding digital archaeology. I found the <a href="https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.24/">Dennis article</a> assigned to us this week intriguing in the perspective it gave surrounding considerations of privacy in a digital world and the usage of digital tools throughout the greater field of archaeology. Maybe this is a generational difference, with me being someone who grew up both during the rise of social media and rapid technological development, but I found some of the concerns raised about these topics&hellip; unconcerning? I don&rsquo;t blink at the warning that everything about me can probably be found online because I grew up being told this message&ndash; even &ldquo;personal&rdquo; things like my medical records are digitized and could technically be accessed by anyone with the right know-how, and because of this, the lines between public and private in this digital world feel completely blurred to me. I think I fall on the more extreme end of &ldquo;not caring&rdquo;, but this belief extends to my work&ndash; if it&rsquo;s digitzed it might as well be made public. Dennis discusses how the performative nature of my generation&rsquo;s reflective work, if made to be public, could hinder future opportunities; but, as the world becomes increasingly digital this shift has also changed how an applicant&rsquo;s work can be seen. A reviewer can see the date stamp attached to a post, and acknowledge that the work isn&rsquo;t recent. If anything, I personally like having my work public because you can look at my first reflection on this blog up to my lastest one and see how I&rsquo;ve progressed or how my views have shifted. The other ethical considerations mentioned in all our readings felt familiar; considering your tools, your bias, who or what you are studying and the associated histories&ndash; is all something I&rsquo;ve learned as a history student and know to be mindful of across everything I study and encounter in life, because everything has some sort of history attached to it.</p>
<p>Now, the ethics surrounding studying a cemetery&hellip; the family I grew up surrounded by are French-Canadian Catholics hailing from rural Québec who continue the tradition of just about as much unusual superstitions as you&rsquo;d expect. As per that influence, the first time I read the project instructions when helping Dr. Graham review the the course site, there was a little voice in the back of my head reminding my that spirits are always watching from above and cemeteries are not a place to reckon with should I want to remain unhaunted. The logical part of my brain can argue this all it wants, but superstition is ingrained within me, and although I could move past that initial religious reasoning, I still felt bad about &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo; the dead&ndash; I mean, how annoying would it be if you&rsquo;re just trying to RIP and then some history student shows up and starts walking all over you taking pictures and measurements for like, 6hrs?</p>
<p>Jokes aside, with that train of thought more ethical questions continued to pop up in my mind, very much within the same line of thought expressed by the Richardson quote I chose to start this reflection with. Is what&rsquo;s public <em>really</em> intended to be public? Many historic cemeteries require some form of permission to access, but they&rsquo;re still public in the sense that technically, anybody could access them. I then thought, since a person chose to be buried with a headstone that can have all sorts of information on them, does it mean that they consented to or wanted themselves to be commemorated? Does it inherently indicate a desire to be remembered? But did they want to be remembered in this way, as in, through an archaeological survey? Their graves photographed and preserved via a technology they couldn&rsquo;t even fathom? Of course, I can never get an actual answer to these questions so I just had to accept the enthusiastic &ldquo;YES&rdquo; from the woman who managed the cemetery I chose to document at Pinhey&rsquo;s Point&ndash; although I still worried about exploiting the dead who had no say in the matter (and who might haunt and/or curse me&hellip;).</p>
<p>In the end, my ethical quandaries ended up being quashed by the physical ones. The first day I arrived on site, with water, snacks, a camera, a portable charger, and my iPad in hand, I was met with a beautiful cemetery lovingly maintained by a woman named Meg who invited me there and her husband. No spirit would haunt me if it meant having to leave a place as pretty as this, I thought. Unfourtunately, I happened to time this first visit with a very rare weather phenomena for the area&ndash; there was no wind despite being situate right beside the Ottawa River, <em>and</em> it had just rained. I entered the cemetery and began labelling and filling in the blanks on my sketchmap where google maps had failed me. There had been a swarm of small bugs following me since I had exited the car, but I assumed they&rsquo;d quickly dissapate. I was <em>very</em> wrong. Instead, midges began to join the party, then mosquitoes, then black flies, until I could no longer stand still, because otherwise the swarming would intensify. I called it quits when it got to the point where I was struggling to see because the bugs started going for my eyes&hellip;</p>
<p>My second and likely final visit this Saturday went much better&ndash; this time I came equipped with bug spray and a stool, so I could actually take pictures of the top the tombs! Weather was hot, there was a strong breeze, and it was sunny but overcast&ndash; <a href="https://spadeandthegrave.com/2020/09/26/photography-of-gravestones-for-a-historic-survey-a-how-to-guide/">perfect for gravestone photography</a>! The main hazard was an obscene amount of yellow jackets (literally, I have never seen so many in my life) resting or hovering along the walls surrounding the cemetery and church ruins, but they didn&rsquo;t seem to care for me at all, only occasionally whizzing by my head on their way to church. In total, I was able to document the basics of 67 monuments in what felt like no time at all! But! You may notice the time at which this is posted and think &ldquo;ah, the life of a university student&rdquo;, yet the reality is that the final physical danger I encountered in my first foray with field work is that I never checked the expiry date on my sunscreen. And because I&rsquo;m so pale, this of course has resulted in most of my Sunday being spent recovering from sun poisoning. In my defense, studying both history and computer science doesn&rsquo;t give me a lot of experience with going outside.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m going to go back to bathing in aloe and chugging gatorade.</p>
